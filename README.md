# Engineering_Design
Work I did for BME 193 EDP, which is an engineering design process course.

My group designed a hands-free GPS clip, which would utilize vibration signals to give direction. I also learned a lot about different aspects of the fabrication process, including CAD, CNC milling, molding and casting, 3D printing, and laser cutting.

My contributions to the project included contributing to design documentation, maintaining the group website, and writing the Python code for our Raspberry Pi prototype. It was my first time working with a Pi, and I really enjoyed it. 

This repo includes the Python code I wrote for the demo in class, and the code for the circuit itself, as well as images from the fabrication process.
